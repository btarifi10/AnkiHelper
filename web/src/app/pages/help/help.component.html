        <h3> First things first </h3>
        <p>
          Before you can use this app, ensure that <i>Anki</i> is running and that the <a
          href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159"><i>Anki Connect</i></a> add-on is
          installed. If it isn't, click the link and follow the instructions to downloading it.
          Once the add on is installed, click <em>Tools > Add-ons</em> to configure the add on.
          <em>AnkiConnect</em> should be on the list - click it and then click the <em>Config</em>
          button. Under "webCorsOriginList", add this site's URL as per the image below:<br>
        </p>

        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="../../assets/anki-ex.png" width="600px">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          All this does is allow the site to communicate with Anki. <br><br>
          Also, this app only works with Microsoft Word or Excel documents that have a <i>.docx</i> or <i>.xlsx</i> file extension. This
          shouldn't be
          a problem unless you are using a very old version of Word. If you are, and have <i>.doc</i> file extension,
          you
          can use an online tool like <a href="https://www.zamzar.com/convert/doc-to-docx/">this</a> one to convert it.
          <br><br>
          Once you have started, you will need to follow three steps in order to create cards using this app.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <br>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
          The first step is to choose the deck that you will be adding cards to. There are three options here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a deck from the list of decks presented. This will mean that all notes processed from files
            will be added to this deck.
          </li>
          <li>Read the deck from the Word document. This will mean each group in your Word document will need to
            have the deck name in the second line, after the number of items in the group. Note that each group will
            need to be assigned to one deck at most, but you can have multiple groups within the same Word document if
            you select this option. If the deck name given does not exist, it will be created.
          </li>
          <li>Create a new deck. This is the same as the first option except a new deck will be created.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Files and templates </h3>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
          Step 2 involves selecting and uploading any number of <i>.docx</i> files which will be scanned and analysed
          for
          cards/notes to be created. Simply upload the files one by one and click on the button to proceed.
        </p>
        <h4>Templates</h4>
        <p>
          For each group of notes you wish to create in Anki, a template has to be followed. Currently, this app
          supports templates which create notes of three models: Cloze, Basic, and Basic with reversed.<br><br>

          In each template, the first line of the group starts with a keyword, and the second line includes the
          number of items as well as the optional deck (see <i>Step 1</i>).<br><br>

          Check the example files to get a quicker understanding of the formats.
        </p>
        <h5>Cloze notes</h5>
        <p>
          The Cloze note template follows a "Name and describe" format. As such, the first line of a group has the
          format:
          <br>
          <span class="text-center"> Name and describe the [<i>title/heading of card</i>]. </span>
        </p>

        The second line will have a number, an optional letter "M", and then the deck name if necessary:
        <ul>
          <li>The number indicates how many items are present, each separated by pressing the "enter/newline" key in
            word
          </li>
          <li>The M, if there should be more than two cloze deletions (more on this).</li>
          <li>The optional deck name</li>
        </ul>

        The following <i>N</i> lines (where N is the number in the second line) are of the format <br>
        <span class="text-center">[<i>name</i>]: [<i>description item 1</i>]; [<i>description item 2</i>];
          ... ; [<i>description item n</i>] </span>
        <br>
        If the "M" is not present, then a cloze note with all the names missing would be created, as well as one with
        all the
        descriptions (so two cards would be created). If the "M" is present, a first cloze note with be created with all
        the names missing, and one subsequent cloze note
        for each item's description (so N+1 cards would be created). This option is intended for longer, more detailed
        descriptions while
        keeping the bigger picture.

        <hr/>


        <h5>Basic, and Reversed</h5>
        In the case of Basic, or Basic and reversed, the format is simpler. The first line contains either the word
        "Basic" or "Reversed", and the second line contains the number of items as well as the optional deck input.

        Following this, the two sides of each card are to be separated by a line with single foward slash ("/") and each
        card
        is separated by a line with a double foward slash ("//").
        <br><br>

        <hr/>


        <h5>Cards from Excel Tables</h5>
        Tables inserted into a Microsoft Excel document will be analysed. It assumes the
        table was inserted using the <em>Insert > Table</em> command (or else it is not
        actually a table, just an arrangement of lines). The column and row headers are
        assumed to be descriptive of the table contents. An example of a table is given below:
        <br>
        <div class="text-center py-2">
            <img src="../../assets/table-ex.png" width="450px">
        </div>
        <br>
        In this case, six cards would be created, one for each student. At the moment, an Excel document
        requires the deck to be already specified (i.e., not within the document but selected on the site).
        <br><br>

        <hr/>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
          All that's left to do is to review the cards being made and hit the confirmation button. Any error messages
          will be shown in this step.
          <br><br>
          Note that this app allows for text-only card creation at this point in time. If you wish to add images, or
          format the cards, you may do so after they are created.
